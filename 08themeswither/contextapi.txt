🚀It's a game changer for React developers! 🚀

✔ Say goodbye to prop drilling and hello to a cleaner, more efficient way of managing state in your applications.

🚀 What is Prop Drilling ❓
In React , Prop drilling is a key concept that involves passing data down the component from a parent component to a deeply nested child component .

🚀Disadvantage Of Prop Drilling 😞 
👉 Code Complexity
👉Reduced Maintainability
👉Performance Overhead
👉Increased Development Time


🚀 Why Context Api ❓ 
In React, passing down props can be effective for sharing data,
but let's face it – passing props through a chain of multiple components
just to reach a specific one can make your code a bit... well, inefficient. 😅

🔑 Context API to the Rescue!
Context API simplifies state management by allowing you to share values like themes,
user authentication, or any global data across your components without the hassle of passing props at every level.
It's like giving your app a streamlined superpower! 💪
